# Omicron-vs-SP500-Project

I was curious on whether the new Covid variant has any significant affect on the S&P500
Hence i started this mini project to explore and find correlation on it's data

However due to the lack of data given in their database for Omicron cases, the results may not be reliable.
As of 12/13/2021, they were only 3 data reported into their database worldwide (Sum of all countries that have reported cases).
